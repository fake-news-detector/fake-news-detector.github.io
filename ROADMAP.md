Fake News Detector Roadmap
==========================

This document gives an idea of the next steps for the Fake News Detector extension, just to give a little guidance on where we should focus our efforts.

### Short Term

- Small changes to make the extension usable and start marketing it to get early feedback ([extension#8](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/8), [extension#1](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/1))
- Add internationalization to also publish it outside Brazil ([extension#2](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/2))
- Add page scrapping to save more data and use it for improving classification later ([api#2](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/2))
- Allow to use the extension across all web (not only facebook) ([extension#7](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/7),  [extension#5](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/7))
- Add pre-categorized domains
([api#5](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/5))

### Medium Term

- Sign in with Facebook to prevent cheating ([extension#4](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/4), [api#4](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/4))
- Add caching, ddos protection, move to digital ocean
- Try to gather the most data as possible (by convincing a lot of people to use the extension and classify)
- Use the good amount to data to improve Robinho with new algorithms, maybe try deep learning

### Long Term

- Publicize it to journalists, fact checking websites and other important vehicles
- Have a backoffice area where journalists and other experts can help classify with safety most popular news
- Keep working on Robinho to improve the accuracy as most as possible

### Maybe Someday

- Have a mobile app/mobile/plugin/custom browser/idk so users can also use the Fake News Detector on mobile (which is the main way people consume news nowadays)
- Allow to submit text and images pieces to analyze, since not always rumors are in links (there are a LOT of rumors running in WhatsApp)
